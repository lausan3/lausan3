# Hey there, I'm Anthony! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a junior at CUNY Hunter College and CUNY City College completing a personalized degree in Computer science and Game programming!

I'm currently taking courses from the City University of New York and doing a game programming fellowship at the EGD Collective!

I've been programming since junior year of high school and have loved it ever since. I love learning about new technologies and helping drive things that I'm passionate about forward. My current focus is developing my knowledge of Artifical Intelligence and Extended Reality.

## My technologies of choice/interests

Here are some of the technologies I use on a daily basis for projects, work, and to build my knowledge!
