# Hey there, I'm Anthony! 👋
## About me
I'm a Junior at the <a href="https://www.cuny.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">City University of New York</a> completing a personalized degree in Computer Science and Game Programming!

I'm also doing a game programming fellowship at the <a href="https://www.egdcollective.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EGD Collective</a>!

I've been programming since junior year of high school and have loved it ever since. I love learning about new technologies and helping drive things that I'm passionate about forward. 

My current focus is developing my knowledge of Artifical Intelligence and Extended Reality (XR/VR/AR)!

## My technologies of choice/interests
